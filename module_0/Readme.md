🌿 The Little Python Garden 🌿
Welcome to your digital backyard! This project is a cozy, beginner-friendly module designed to help you learn the "seeds" of Python programming. Instead of boring math problems, we’re going to manage a garden inventory together.

✨ What’s Inside?

We use basic Python tools to keep our garden tidy. Here is what you’ll learn:

input(): Asking the gardener for the plant's name.

int(): Converting text into numbers so we can count our seeds.

.capitalize(): Making sure our flower names start with a pretty capital letter.

print(): Showing our inventory on the screen.

print(f""): Using "f-strings" to create beautiful, personalized garden reports.


📂 Project Structure

Each exercise is contained in its own directory. To complete a module, navigate to the folder and follow the instructions in the exXX.py file.

V	        ex00	    Hello Garden	    print()
VI	        ex01	    Garden Plot Area	int(), Operators
VII	        ex02	    Harvest Total	    input(), float()
VIII	    ex03	    Plant Age Check	    Booleans, Comparison
IX	        ex04	    Water Reminder	    .capitalize(), .upper()
X	        ex05	    Count to Harvest	range(), Loops
XI	        ex06	    Garden Summary	    f-strings

🚀 How to Run

This project is designed to be tested inside the Python Interpreter.

Navigate to the specific exercise directory:

Bash

cd ex01
Launch the Python interpreter:

Bash

python3
Inside the interpreter (>>>), import your function and call it:

Python

>>> from ex6 import ft_count_harvest_recursive.py
>>> ft_count_harvest_recursive()
